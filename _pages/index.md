The best way to learn a programming language is to use it to build something interesting. Lately I've been spending some time learning **Rust**, and I at some point I started to feel the itch to go beyond toy exercises and start something more tangible. I wanted my first project to tackle an interesting problem, but be not too complex, since I'm only doing my first steps in Rust. 

An old, but classic book [Etudes for programmers][etudes], by Charles Wetherell, gave me a plethora of ideas. I decided to take on an etude called *Ye Soule of Witte*, which challenges a reader with writing a program that implements an algorithm for text compression. 

I've also decided to document my journey through the project, and record my learnings in a series of blog posts. Learning something new is fun, but the new knowledge can quickly fade away. I've found that taking notes on what I've learned is a great way to solidify the understanding of the subject. 

The source code for the project is available on [GitHub][github].
